# <p align="center"> **Discord Bots Repo (for showcasing)** </p>
This repository is home to a few of my Discord bots that I've developed. They are written in Python utilizing [Rapptz's Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/), which is an API wrapper. There are 3 bots total, VibeBot, ClutchGaming, and Guppy, details may be found below.

### <p align="center"> Additional Info </p>
VibeBot: My public discord bot, that can be found at the link above. It is strictly an entertainment bot that allows users to request a "vibe check". The vibes are randomly chosen from a constantly-updated list, generated from admin and community input. It is currently in over 450 servers and has issued thousands of vibe checks <br>
<br>
Guppy: Simple role-management bot developed for a friend of mine<br>
<br>
ClutchGaming: My own discord and remote server management bot, found in my community server. The remote server management allows my administrative team to carry out remote actions on our servers <br>
<br>
<br>
Small note: Discord.py is being continued as of April 2022, it is recommended to utilize a different API wrapper or Javascript. <br>
Smaller note: Those nosy enough, the bot tokens in this repository are defunct, no point in trying them ;)
